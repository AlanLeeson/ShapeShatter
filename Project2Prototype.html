		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<h3>Mechanics</h3>
		<p>
			The player can click on one of the shapes at either ends of a rope to start
			controlling the rope. The player can swing the rope around the screen by
			moving their finger.  Shapes will spawn at the corners of the screen 
			that will damage the player if they collide with the shapes at the end of
			the player's rope.  The player's objective is to destroy the opposing shapes 
			by making them collide with the rope section between the two shape ends. 
			The screen does not move and enemies will spawn infinitely in waves. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p><strong>One Finger Press</strong> - Moves an anchor which enacts a 
		force on the opposite anchor.</p>
		
		<h3>Player Learning</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing the player needs to learn is how to control the string and two
			anchors. The player should try pressing either the square or the triangle on
			the screen. When pressed, the other anchor will suddenly be affected by
			physics and the user will see the anchor begin to fall. When the player moves 
			their finger, they will see that the anchor they are holding follows the 
			finger and the rope between the two, pulls the other anchor along in a 
			swinging motion. From this point the player can play the game and will learn 
			through trial and error. When the rope collides with enemies, they earn 
			points but if an anchor hits an enemy then the round is reset. The player will
			fail very quickly but with no penalty because the round can be immediately 
			restarted. The last thing the player needs to learn is that when they let go
			of an anchor, the rope freezes and physics no longer affects the other anchor.
			All the enemies stop moving as well. This will teach the player that the game 
			is essentially paused when a finger is not on an anchor. This allows the 
			player time to think about avoiding enemies or how to get the highest combo. 
			The player can then press on either anchor to enact a force on the opposite 
			one and continue the game.
